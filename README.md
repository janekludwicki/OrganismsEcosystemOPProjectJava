## Organisms Ecosystem Project
This project is a simulation of an ecosystem, implemented in Java. It features various organisms, each represented by a unique character icon, interacting in a world. Each organism has properties such as strength, initiative, age, and position. They can perform actions, collide with other organisms, and age. Some organisms have special collision effects. The state of each organism can be saved and loaded, allowing for the simulation to be paused and resumed. The project uses the AWT library for handling key events and drawing the organisms.
